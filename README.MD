This repo contains a simple bot using 
[DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

Currently it just wrapps a string.Contains() around m.Content() in a particular 
channel to facilitate more functionality we couldn't get with another bot we 
were using. More functionality may come in the future. 

This is mostly a project to help increase my Go and Discord knowledge ðŸ™‚
